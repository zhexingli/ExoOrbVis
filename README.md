# ExoOrbVis
Orbital visualization tool for direct imaging exoplanets.

This code:
- provides top-down and sky visualization view of direct imaging exoplanets
- color-codes orbits using first-order estimation of planet-star flux ratio variations.
- can incorporate future mission specs such as IWA, OWA, occulter transmittance profile.
- calculates planet visibility according to planet phase and provided instrument specs.
- includes HZ calculation and visualization along with provided orbits.

Please let me know if this code will be used in your research or publication.
